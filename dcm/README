Different steps for DCM preparation and analysis:

1/ reorganization of the onsets and duration with parametric modulation: 
reorg_onsets_dcm_param_mod.m

2/ make new GLMs with these new onsets:
AUD_loc_glm_dcm_param.m

3/ extract signals from the VOIs, selected on whatever you want (here from the auditive run):
AUD_loc_dcm_voi_creation.m
